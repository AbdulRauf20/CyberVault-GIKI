# CyberVault-GIKI
Cyber Vault is a C++ OOP project with Qt GUI that secures files using XOR/Vigenère encryption, analyzes password strength, checks breaches, and hides secret messages in BMP images via steganography

# 🔐 Cyber Vault – Your Friendly Neighborhood Cybersecurity Toolkit

> “When hiding passwords in .txt wasn’t risky enough, we moved to hiding them in images.”

Cyber Vault is a C++ OOP-based semester project built to **secure files, analyze passwords**, and even **hide secret messages inside BMP images** (yes, for real). With a clean **Qt GUI**, it's not just functional—it looks good while protecting your secrets too.

| Feature                        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🖼️ **Steganography in BMP**     | Hide text inside images (because what’s more secure than hiding it in a meme?) |
| 🔐 **XOR & Vigenère Encryption**| Basic but effective file encryption techniques.                             |
| 🔍 **Password Analyzer**        | Rates your password and judges it silently.                                |
| ⚠️ **Breach Checker**           | Checks your password against known breached passwords.                     |
| 📊 **Cyber Health Score**       | Rates your digital hygiene based on password + encryption usage.           |
| 📜 **Activity Logger**          | Keeps a track of what you encrypt/decrypt (for... academic honesty 🫣).     |
| 🖥️ **Qt GUI**                   | Button-based UI because we got tired of typing in the terminal.            |
